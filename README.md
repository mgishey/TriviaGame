# TriviaGame

This is an NFL trivia game with 10 questions.  Each question has a time limit of 15 seconds.  If the clock runs out before a question is answered it is chalked up as unanswered.  The rest are scored as correct or incorrect.  When a question is answered or the time runs out, the correct answer is displayed as well as an animated gif image that depicts that correct answer.  At the end of each game a "start over" button is displayed and the game begins anew without reloading the page.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
